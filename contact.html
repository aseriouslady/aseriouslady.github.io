  <span class="first">What I do:</span>
<br>
  I listen to people’s stories and amplify their voices to promote social change.
<br><br>
  By telling stories, I support progressive organizations by creating strategic marketing material that builds awareness and inspires action. I have a background in creating written and video media, and am adept at managing various types of story distribution, including social media platforms, newsletters, blogs, and print material.

<span class="first">Who I am: </span>
  <br>
  I’m a Texas transplant living in the North Carolina Triangle, which is a truly magical place. I like reading books and watching films, then discussing them at length. I also enjoy being outdoors and striking up conversations with strangers.
<br> <br>
  Interested in collaborating? Want to send me book/movie recommendations?

  Talk to me.
