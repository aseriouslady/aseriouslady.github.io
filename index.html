    <p class="home"><span class="first">Hello. </span>I'm Taylor, a University of North Carolina grad. My degree is in Comparative Literature, though my interests range across subjects, from coding to social sciences. I swear I'm not as pretentious as my subheader sounds. I do like to think of myself as a storyteller, and a platform for others to tell their stories. I began storytelling primarily through writing, but through countless hours of Netflix "research", changed my focus to justice-oriented documentary film. </p>
