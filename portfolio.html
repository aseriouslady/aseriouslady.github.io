<p class="portfolio"><span class="first">UNC-TV Jockey's Ridge State Park Special <br>selected for screening at the 2016 Carolina Environmental Film Festival</span><br>The name is deceiving, but UNC-TV is the state’s public television station. This special, airing on the channel in 2015, was created in collaboration with a small team of students under the direction of a professor for a Science Documentary TV Course. As scriptwriter, I wrote the reporter’s dialogue and puzzle-pieced our interviews and b-roll into its current form (a UNC-TV videographer did the actual editing). I also did a significant amount of research, scheduling, and interviewing for the project. </p>

<p class="portfolio"><span class="first">Dear Durham</span><br>This piece is my final project for the 2016 Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University’s weeklong Video Institute.  The Institute is an intensive crash course on all aspects of documentary filmmaking, from pre-production, to camera work, to editing. My collaborator Kate Mathews and I created this piece from scratch in less than seven days with the guidance of instructors.
