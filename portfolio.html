<h2>Film</h2>
<p class="portfolio"><span class="first">UNC-TV Jockey's Ridge State Park Special <br>selected for screening at the 2016 Carolina Environmental Film Festival</span><br>The name is deceiving, but UNC-TV is the state’s public television station. This special, airing on the channel in 2015, was created in collaboration with a small team of students under the direction of a professor for a Science Documentary TV Course. As scriptwriter, I wrote the reporter’s dialogue and puzzle-pieced our interviews and b-roll into its current form (a UNC-TV videographer did the actual editing). I also did a significant amount of research, scheduling, and interviewing for the project. </p>

<p class="portfolio"><span class="first">Short: Deconstructing the Male Gaze </span><br>Still a work in progress. My first video project represents an attempt to overcome the fear and anxiety that I feel around my creative arts by focusing on a deeper anxiety that I, and many others, have been conditioned to feel through mainstream film. I have plans to extend the film to include a celebratory sequence following the current film’s final scene in which we see the protagonist actor acting candidly, while also featuring others embracing their version of femininity, in all of its complexity.
